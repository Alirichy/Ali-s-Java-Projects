This was a fun little game I made in the begining of my summer break last year. This Java project implements a simple and interactive Number Guessing Game. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user's task is to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback for each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The user continues guessing until they successfully identify the random number.
